# Azure Active Directory Hybrid Lab - PowerShell version

This is lab is the same that the one referenced on based on the the one available on [https://github.com/lavanack/laurentvanacker.com/tree/master/Azure/Azure%20Virtual%20Desktop/AAD-Hybrid-Lab](https://github.com/lavanack/laurentvanacker.com/tree/master/Azure/Azure%20Virtual%20Desktop/AAD-Hybrid-Lab) but in a full Powershell version  instead of using ARM templates.
The default values remain the same as the original version (ARM-based). Feel free to customize the values to your needs.
