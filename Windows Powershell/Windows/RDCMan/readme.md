# Remote Desktop Connection Manager

You'll fond here some scripts related to Remote Desktop Connection Manager.
* [Get-RDCManCredential.ps1](Get-RDCManCredential.ps1) will give you clear text credentials from a RDCMan file. Can be useful when, like me, you generate a lot of test VMs (HyperVM or Azure) with randomly generated passwords and you forget them (but you have stored them in a RDCMan file)
